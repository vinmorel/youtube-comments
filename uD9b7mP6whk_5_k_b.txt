Beheading was a punishment for the upper class in the middelages, whereas normal people were hanged. On the other hand: yes, murder was punished by breaking on the wheel. But murder was a different thing in the medieval times and further on. There was a more magical understanding. If the killer covered the corpse, it was murder, even if death wasn't even intended.

In the Alamo the Americans where not the natives but the invaders. Big, very big difference. American life is 180 of the "German - All men" life-view. Not better than Us/ Not better than others.

['*_Revelation 13.13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. 15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\r 18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666._*\r\n*_Matthew 11.28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."_*\r\n*_Luke 19.10 for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.‚Äù_*\r\n_Only Jesus Christ saves.  Repent and be saved.  Jesus Christ loves you.  God bless you, and peace be upon you and your family in the name of Jesus Christ..._']
