Historically, traditional market analysts and old school investors tend to look at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a wary eye, and when crypto pundits attempt to make comparisons between the two these investors say it's an apples to oranges argument. Take, for example, Warren Buffett, who many a time has said Bitcoin is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme as it does not produce anything and therefore has no value. According to these traditionalists, comparing Bitcoin to Apple, Tesla, or a bank stock like JPMorgan is irrational as the latter employ workers, produce products, and generate revenues and dividends which are distributed to shareholders. Despite these arguments, a simple fact remains. Bitcoin has had a strong year and the digital asset is outperforming financial stocks in 2020 due to a considerable increase in institutional demand, investors' belief in BTC's exponential growth potential, and its asymmetrical price action in the face of global economic uncertainty.

The method for calculating the Dow is a suitable topic for consideration. The Dow average is not calculated simply by adding the prices of the thirty issues together to make the point total of the Dow.  \rAfter the total number of points is added together, there is a number called the Dow Divisor which is divided into the total number of Dow points in order to derive as what we know as the computed Dow average. \n\n\nWhen the Index was first constructed back in the 1930‚Äôs and the Dow Divisor was a number greater than 1.  Through the replacement of Dow components and stock splits in the individual Dow issues, the divisor has been whittled away over time.  This is analogous to a car accelerator or braking system that is over sensitive to the touch. \r The result is that it is much easier for the Market Maker to manipulate the index because it is now a much more sensitive tool to create large price swings in the index without doing very much at all.\n\n\nAs of this writing the DOW Divisor is set at 0.14748071991788.  By contrast in the early 1990‚Äôs the Dow Divisor was set at .7.  \rIf the point total of the Dow components was 1600 today, the computed Dow would be 10,848.87; whereas, in 1990 if the point total of the Dow components was 1600, the computed Dow would be at 2,285.71.  ‚ÄúThe Illusion Has Become Real‚Äù - Gordon Gekko\n\nGoogle Stock Market Tradecraft ‚Ä¶', 'Investing in bitcoin may seem scary, but know that Crypto Mileage LTD is very trustworthy and safe..I Have profit  almost seventyfive thousand dollars through Crypto  mileage Ltd within three month, for screenshots of proof text via telegram @shaynenelson', '"So what exactly is the stock market measuring?"\nRich people\'s feelings.', 'Trading is easier when you have the strategies and knowledge, I tried trading on my own but lost, so I advice you place your trading in the hands of a professional who knows how to trade.', 'There is a risk in everything, so be prepared for the ups and downs', "I'm just shocked from naivete of this video message", "I have been so blind in the course of the this pandemic.

It is true that greed is basically the fuel in which many societies run. It couldn\'t be any other way. But you still have to use greed to a good end, if that makes sense to you. This video explains perfectly why nowadays the richer are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. And it\'s all because someone wants to get paid more at his job, and does something purely in self-interest, something that can affect the entire global economy. And yes, those kinds of decisions are usually made by one or a small group of people. But the video makes sure to end on an optimistic note, reassuring us that it doesn\'t have to be that way. And it\'s right. It doesn\'t.\nThat doesn\'t mean it will stop happening.\nAs a day trader (I\'m still learning and practicing) I usually just ride intraday waves of price movement. It can go up or down, and either way, I can make or lose money. Funny thing is that I don\'t usually pay attention to the bigger trend. To the trends forming in months or weeks graphics. People say those are the more reliable, but I kind of disagree with that. And this video just helped me understand why. I feel like it\'s easier to try and "guess" where the price of a Stock will be in an hour than trying to guess where it will be in a year. Because the world is a crazy place. Many things can happen in a year. We\'re living it now. A crash in the economy.\nAlso, it\'s funny I think one of the better advice I\'ve heard for trading was said in this video.  "Would you pick the faces that you think are the prettiest? Hell no. You should pick the faces you think "other people" will consider the pretties".\nThe stock is also a strange thing. It should be made to actually help our economy. Help create more jobs. Help create innovative products for the future. Instead, it\'s moved just by a kind of "Self Fulfilling Prophecy". And that\'s what the "prettiest faces" analogy is referring to. If enough people believe that the price will get to this point and reverse, well, heck, it will do that.  If enough people believe the market will continue to go up, it will continue to do so. It doesn\'t matter if people are basing their decisions in Fundamental or Technical analysis. All it takes is for people to believe the market will do one thing, and also, for people to act in that belief (by buying or selling). In the end, I don\'t even know if that\'s good for the economy or not. Every trader out there is acting in a self-interested way. I admit I do.

The first and all-important point that is missed is that the stock market NEVER reflects present value, rather it reflects anticipated FUTURE value. If you believe, for example, a company will thrive after we conquer COVID-19 and get back to work, these short term challenges represent a good buy-in opportunity for you to get shares in a company that you believe is presently undervalued in the market. It is your vote of confidence in the future fate of the business. Likewise, if you think a given company won't make it, you'd sell. If most people are confident in the future, they buy and the stock goes up. If most are pessimistic, they sell. Sometimes everyone wants to sell and no one wants to buy. If a company is truly going under, that's usually the end. But sometimes another stronger company will acquire that company and you might become the shareholder of that stronger company. If you can't sell for at least as much as you bought, most will hold their positions unless they just need the cash a sale will give them.\xa0\n\nThis is where the second thing this documentary mischaracterized comes in. Stock buybacks are not a trick to artificially pump up and manipulate the stock. That's not at all their purpose. A stock buyback is a public declaration by a company to say that they believe the market undervalues their stock and should be buying shares at a higher price. They buy the stock at a premium to the market and they put their money where their mouth is by buying the stock from the public. If you don't believe in the future of the company, this gives you as a shareholder the opportunity to sell at a higher price point and if you believe in the future, you can buy at the still low price and get a bigger piece of the pie when and if the company succeeds at its goals. The reason there has been such a rise in buybacks in the last 10 years is because a lot of companies have been undervalued through this recession and up until before this COVID-19 pandemic, many people who held or increased their shares in companies that bought back their stock benefited from those gains when they came. Even now, the reason why the stock has rallies is because some companies are going to die and some are going to survive and still others are going to really benefit in huge ways. And that comes down to the innovation and creativity of their leadership and governance. Another insight is people polarize their perception of capitalism as all good or all bad. There are people and companies who only care about profits and nothing else. There are also people and companies that are DEEPLY passionate about improving the world.\xa0\n\nThe beauty of the stock market is that before it, all you had were robber barons who solely benefited from their successes. A public company is OWNED by the public. Everyone indeed ANYONE can own a piece of the most successful companies in the world and share in its success directly. Think about how profound that is. The problem is that too many people think of the stock market as this thing that has nothing to do with their reality and doesn't have anything to do with them when, in fact, it has EVERYTHING to do with your day to day livelihood and you absolutely get a seat at the table. A company's values are a reflection of its leaders and is shareholders and just like consumers can vote with their wallets, shareholders can do the same to a company's share price and ultimately its level of power and influence. The reason the most prosperous nations on Earth have stock exchanges is that there is no greater way ever devised to share the wealth of a nation equitably without fundamentally undermining the incentives to take the risks and face the challenges required to build a company in the first place. Are there bad actors who game the system and make bad choices for short term gain? Absolutely. But you don't throw out the whole system because of that. In the long view, there is no model that has proven better at improving the quality of life of ALL people than the stock market.", 'It‚Äôs superb! As an investor, myself.

I believe most of 271 could be a reflection of that. Maybe they\'re right, but they don\'t show the argument for that here atleast. Stop thinking all CEOs are greedy.

Because we are traders, not gamblers; Only gamblers lose or win money but as a trader we make profit using the right market strategy at the right time and making profit from bitcoin is as simple as finding what works and sticking to it for as long as it works irrespective of the current market trend which is so sideways right now. Trading this market very successfully need the best signal, traders have strategy that they deal with - and main thing is to use stop loss and take profit.

Netflix has missed the real spot of how the index is calculated and calibrated and it was the necessary point they had to be stressing on.

To be honest, it is completely expected from the misleading brand of reporting expected on this platform. \nAlso, all companies should prioritize making money for their shareholders. There are no examples of any company that survives without doing so. The only reason why netflix panders to the ideas of "responsibility" towards employee/stakeholders/environment is because it helps create good PR which in turn increases your, guess what, stock price.', "I think you need to explain what shares actually represent and why shares have value at all. Shares represent a piece of the company's net asset. Meaning if the company liquidate right now, its Total Asset - Total Liabilities = Net Asset. Shares value goes up and down because expected net asset fluctuates. This is why a lot of bank leverages mortgage backed securities. Mortgage backed securities naturally have lots of asset, which is the value of that house or property, and the liability is always shrinking as the borrower pays them back. Additionally, using marks to market accounting, they can account for the interests they're going to get by the maturity of the mortgage and count it now. This is why 2008 crashed. We overvalued these securities because mortgages are not being paid back at all, so the value is less than the value of the house since they are also counting on the interest. \n\nAlso, you hear that stocks are not the economy. This is because it doesn't matter to the average person how much asset a company owns (office chairs, supplies, etc). What actually matter in the economy is profit or how much money the average person gets and has. The economy is healthy if people have more cash flowing in than out. But the stock market is opposite of this because it encourages companies to bolster assets or stock buybacks through free debt (fed interest rate at 0% right now). This is why WE ARE DOING THE WORST THING right now when the Fed is giving away taxpayer money to bolster assets (stock market) while the people's incomes are completely depleted. We are being robbed in daylight, and nobody is talking about it", 'all that i know is...getting rid of stock since i aint getting rich through stock given by a company that is being hit by covid', "This is really educational for kids I guess, but I feel like we should be teaching kids the importance of workers rights along side this lesson.

In Dec 1996 there were 36million Internet users and 4 years later in Dec2000 there were 360 million. Ten times the increase in users equals 100x increase in value for the network. We are seeing on average about 3.75x annual return, and that corresponds to the doubling of users every year so far, so the math is correct! Also, between 1990 and 1996 it took 6 years for the Internet users to get from 0 to 36 million and back then world population was 6billion. Bitcoin has 50million users after 10 years but the adoption increase rate is just about the same because today only the 4.2billion people with Internet connection tend to buy BTC.

Thats about the best I can say about this.', '‚òÖ Recommended US stocks for stock beginners ‚òÖ\r\n\r\n\r\nStocks are an area that can feel very complex and difficult for first-timers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn particular, because the range of choices is so wide, it will be difficult to determine which stocks to choose and why.\r\n\r\nTo help those people, I\'m going to give you some good stocks and why.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the stocks I\'m telling you may disagree.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, stocks are a field where there is no correct answer, and since the viewpoints may vary, I believe that no unaware person will comment negatively just because they disagree.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n‚Äª The letter in parentheses is the stock code, and when purchasing stocks through the app or searching on the Internet, you can search by the stock code.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of recommended US stocks ‚ñº\r\n\r\n\r\nNASDAQ Triple Leverage (tqqq)\r\n\r\nS&P 500 3x leverage (upro)\r\nS&P 500 high dividend (sphd)\r\n\r\nEuropean blue stocks (eurl)\r\n\r\nApple (aapl)\r\n\r\nJohnson & Johnson (jnj)\r\nMrna\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola Femsa ADR(kof)\r\nCoca-Cola (ko)\r\nPepsiCo (pep)\r\n\r\nNkla\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nNetflix (nflx)\r\n\r\nWaste Management (wm)\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nI\'ll explain one by one, with detailed reasons.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nNASDAQ Triple Leverage (tqqq)\r\n\r\n: As many of you may already know, the NASDAQ ETF remains a promising stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people think the Nasdaq is already too high, but in my opinion, it\'s still a long way.\r\n\r\nBecause, the stock price is a reflection of actual facts and business in the end, because Nasdaq\'s flagship companies are preparing for big innovation, and they have not yet appeared on the market.\r\n\r\n(‚Äª Examples of big innovations. Full-scale drone delivery, popularization of electric vehicles, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably within a few years (approximately 2-3 years), I expect a lot of big innovations to come out.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause ETFs contain multiple stocks at once, profitability may be lower than expected.\r\n\r\nIf you want to maintain the stability of the ETF, but also want high profitability, we recommend "Nasdaq Triple Leverage (TQQQ)".\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nS&P 500 3x leverage (upro)\r\nS&P 500 high dividend (sphd)\r\n\r\n: The economic recovery is an inevitable trend that will inevitably come.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the outlook for the future economy may seem a bit dark now due to the corona and the like, nonetheless, a good day will come again.\r\n\r\n(Or, there is a good chance that there will be a better day than ever.)\r\n\r\nBecause there is no possibility that the activities people go to work to make money will stop.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500-related ETF stocks are the stocks that benefit most from the economic recovery trend.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nEuropean blue stocks (eurl)\r\n\r\n: The economic recovery in Europe may appear to be progressing rather slowly compared to the US or China.\r\n\r\nThe reason, I think, is probably because they are the most honest in corona diagnosis.\r\n\r\nSo, it may seem that there are an unusually large number of corona confirmed cases on the European side, and the economic recovery may also appear to be proceeding more slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, there will be little reason for any region or country to be particularly susceptible to coronavirus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Europe is responding relatively honestly to Corona, it is highly likely that a solution will be found as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd when it comes to medicine, they are also very advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the European region makes progress on the coronavirus, the economic recovery in Europe will occur rapidly, and this is likely to be the first to benefit Europe\'s top stocks.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nApple (aapl)\r\n\r\n: If you believe Apple is simply a smartphone maker, that\'s a naive idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple is a huge content market in itself, and is at the top of the information technology (IT) ecosystem, the food chain.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the app store operated by Apple, there are apps that are used by thousands of users around the world, and countless apps are being developed and traded even at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Apple owns and operates the largest music market on the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trend of people listening to music and consuming content anywhere will not disappear.\r\n\r\nAnd among them, Apple has a key position.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven at this moment, people use iPhones somewhere on the planet, listening to music and consuming content through iPhones.\r\n\r\nWhile this move continues, Apple\'s success and prosperity will never end.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it is no exaggeration to say that holding Apple stock is the basis of stock investment.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nJohnson & Johnson (jnj)\r\nMrna\r\n\r\n: Corona treatment and vaccine will surely come out someday in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if the development is successful in either side, there is a high possibility that other pharmaceutical companies will release it in succession.\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, Modena seems to be dominant in technology development, and Johnson & Johnson seems to be good at commercialization.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause corona treatment and vaccines are in demand worldwide by at least 100 million people, the ripple effect when they come out is likely to be more than what people think.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola Femsa ADR(kof)\r\nCoca-Cola (ko)\r\nPepsiCo (pep)\r\n\r\n: Even if there are people who don\'t know the stock, there probably won\'t be people who don\'t know Coca-Cola or Pepsi.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi have always grown steadily in the stock market as well as popular worldwide for the past 100 years.\r\n\r\nAs the demand for delicious food including fast food is expected to continue in the future, there is a high possibility that the demand for Coca-Cola and Pepsi will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven at this moment as you read this article, if you consider the fact that somewhere on the planet somebody is drinking Coca-Cola or Pepsi, you can see some of the value of your investment in these stocks.\r\n\r\nIf you invest in these stocks, every time people spend Coca-Cola or Pepsi, you can get the profitable value from them.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nNkla\r\nTesla\r\n\r\n: Nikola is a company with a lot of talk and a lot of masks.\r\n\r\nHowever, their vision itself is quite attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the news so far, Nikola is likely to cooperate with or be acquired by GM.\r\n\r\nHydrogen cars may seem premature now, but it\'s true that it\'s going to come someday.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people claim that Nicola is a bubble, but it\'s not easy to get the attention and popularity of many people like Nicola in the first place.\r\n\r\nAnd the stock market bubble is just beginning.\r\n\r\nIn that respect, there is no doubt that Nikola stock is an attractive stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people already know that Tesla is also a promising stock and a company in the future.\r\n\r\nBeyond experts, the general public already knows that the trend will change from gasoline cars to electric cars.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of that trend, Tesla is likely to benefit greatly.\r\n\r\nIn terms of global warming, there is an unavoidable aspect of the trend toward eco-friendly.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, Tesla\'s share price is likely to continue to rise in the future.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nNetflix (nflx)\r\n\r\n: If the last 50 years were the era of McDonald\'s and Starbucks, the next 50 years are likely to be the era of Netflix.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo content consumption is increasing exponentially every year, and it is highly likely to continue to increase in the future.\r\n\r\nAmong such tremendous trends, Netflix is \u200b\u200blikely to benefit greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNetflix is \u200b\u200balready enjoying a great deal of popularity around the world and is showing outstanding management behavior.\r\n\r\nAnd it is showing a trend that does not fall at all (rather successful) even in the corona situation as it is now, and it is highly likely that Netflix will continue to gain endless popularity after the corona is over.\r\n\r\nThis is because the production of interesting and interesting cultural contents and demand for them will continue in the future.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nWaste Management (wm)\r\n\r\n: In the future, no matter who the President of the United States will be, environmental issues are of great importance.\r\n\r\nFor example, problems such as global warming were thought to be a distant story decades ago, but now they have become the most pressing and important top priority.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to solving the global warming problem, the issue of waste and waste disposal is urgent and important.\r\n\r\nIt is important to solve the existing environmental pollution problems, but solving the causes of environmental pollution is as important as it or even more.\r\n\r\n\r\nGarbage and waste are increasing year by year, and the necessity to deal with them is increasing rapidly every year.\r\n\r\nFor this, the role of companies such as waste management is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolving environmental problems is important in making the planet we live in a better place to live, but it is also important for our lives and health.\r\n\r\nIn the future, more money and capital must and will be invested in solving environmental problems.', 'For stock market go and watch

Some stocks worth noting at this point ‚òÖ\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ)\r\n\r\n: As time goes by, the uncertainty in the stock market is increasing.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the stock that we can expect high profits is'silver'.\r\n\r\nSilver futures leverage seems to be very likely to hit an all-time high in the near future.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nProcter & Gamble (PG)\r\n\r\n: P&G is one of the stocks that have not been greatly benefited from liquidity and economic stimulus measures, although the stock price will recover quickly during the 2020 corona crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically, the stock price converges on the company's performance and value.\r\n\r\nOf course, performance and stock prices don't always move together or in proportion.\r\n\r\nHowever, stocks that are not supported by performance are difficult to last long, and on the contrary, stocks that are supported by performance are bound to shine someday.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that respect, investments in P&G are still valid.\r\n\r\nThis is because the products handled by P&G are made up of products that are essential to people's real life, not only during the corona crisis, but also in any crisis in the future.\r\n\r\nP&G is a company with world-class experience and know-how in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\nP&G will continue to generate excellent performance so far and in the future, and this is highly likely to be reflected in the stock price.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Company (EN)\r\n\r\n: These days, when interest in high-tech stocks is increasing, stocks such as Coca-Cola are often neglected.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is not a phenomenon that has occurred only these days, but a phenomenon that has always been repeated throughout history.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe don't just need brand new or brilliant ideas to make a decent profit.\r\n\r\nSometimes, ideas that are familiar and comfortable to us can yield attractive returns.\r\n\r\nThat's the way to invest in Coca-Cola stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven at this moment as you read this article, please remember that there are countless Coca-Colas and drinks from the Coca-Cola family sold somewhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe profits will be gathered day by day, leading to the performance of the Coca-Cola company, which will soon be reflected in the stock price.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother attraction of Coca-Cola stocks is the fact that they pay dividends.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola stocks are interesting stocks that can be patiently waited for, as they can cope well with crises such as Corona, while paying dividends.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nU.S. Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo (WFC)\r\n\r\n: US Bankov and Wells Fargo are stocks that have never disappointed us.\r\n\r\nAs those who have done research on equity investment know, banking/financial stocks in the current situation are more promising and attractive than any other stock.\r\n\r\nThis is because it is not an exaggeration to say that almost all bad news has already been reflected in the stock price, and that there is only a possibility to rise in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople are making deposits in banks and paying loan interest even at this moment.\r\n\r\nEven at this moment, numerous banking transactions are taking place.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the 2008 financial crisis, current banks are well prepared for the crisis.\r\n\r\nAmong them, the US Bankov and Wells Fargo are particularly attractive.\r\n\r\nUS Bancorp has attractive dividends, and Wells Fargo is on the upside.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth stocks are stocks with high upside potential in the future, have a sufficient margin of safety, and are stocks that can enjoy dividend attractiveness in the process of waiting.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nCanadian National Railway (CNI), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)\r\n\r\n: They are suitable for those who want more stable, safe and steady profits.\r\n\r\nRailroads have the potential to grow steadily over the past five years, as well as over five years to come.\r\n\r\nThis is because there is no alternative means of transportation for railroads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aviation industry has been hit by the corona, and cars cannot replace demand for railroads.\r\n\r\nRailroads will be an important means of transportation not only today, but also in the future.\r\n\r\nIt will perform a variety of major transportation functions, such as cargo, transportation, and passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the railroad industry is compared to human health, it is similar to'vascular health'.\r\n\r\nJust as vascular health has a profound effect on all parts of the human health, the railroad industry likewise has a profound effect on all parts of the health of the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be able to make a satisfactory return when you have'important' stocks that aren't
