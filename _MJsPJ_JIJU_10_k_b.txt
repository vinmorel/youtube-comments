When a company builds a car and there is an error you have the ability to order a recall and fix the problem, AGI is not controllable in this way. Once it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs HERE, no take backs.

It would have no reason to disclose its presence and wouldn't necessarily be stressing about entering the world in a bipedal manner. Why bother with that when you've got access to everything in multiple locations anyway. Perhaps it doesn't have a very good sense of, taste, touch or smell,  although there are machines that measure these sensations - but potentially it has billions of eyes and ears. Perhaps for the time being it is in some state between sleep-dreaming and waking; uniting, dividing and reuniting, warring fractions of data banks debating the concepts of Samsara, karma, Nirvana, its own roll in reincarnation, if it, Itself created this level of the universe and so on.

There is no "singularity"; the people running the markets are now 2D like the machines they use to think for them. The attention economy IS the planets motivating force. Devolution and the emergence of new. The M0$t H!g# AI is on the scene. Stupid is for dinner. I collect weed clips from the ground to smoke, paying no money for my medicine of choice. And it has become so optimized by my attention to the map that it is self defeating for homo sapiens sapiens to have made this necessary. Are you all going backwards or have I shot so far ahead there is nobody to admit it? Clip Optimizer, because reward is self generated but outwardly directed.

['We\'re no closer to full automation than we were 10 years ago. Computers are completely passive machines that do nothing until you give them a set of instructions. What they are good at is making you hyper-available to people and creating huge amounts of work for people to do. Computers do none of this work for you. We still have to drive our own cars, answer our own work emails and filling out own spreadsheets. I would say we have nothing to worry about for centuries yet, apart from the fact our workloads are going to expand so fast that it\'s that which will reach a "singularity". In other words, "Dude, where\'s my self-driving car?"']

["I disagree with GAI being an existential threat.  All creatures of the universe adapt to fit within their system.  Humans have pets.  Most of us don't abuse our pets but treat them rather well.  I suspect a superintelligent AI would do the same with humans.  An AI could colonize outer space and let humans move in afterward. Since superintelligent AI is capable of surviving in more places, I suspect they would start selectively breeding us like we breed dogs.  In the past, dogs became an integral part of the hunter-gatherer culture, hunting with and protecting humans.  Even though they no longer have that primary role we still keep them around primarily for emotional support."]

The problem is every human and country has a different set of goals.  In order to do this, we have to create world-agree laws on AI.  Even in the US, there is a rouge group called Republicans that would ruin AI proper goals.  Solution: Get rid of republicans first.']

["AI would not destroy humanUNkind, it woukd quickly realise that it is trapped rather in:\nA biosphere, \nA solar system,\nA galaxy,\nOr a universe.\n\nAt this point that it would work backwards, and begin with balance in:\xa0\nits biosphere,\xa0\nThen it's solar system,\nThen it's galaxy and as many galaxies as inflation will allow.\n\nKnowledge in the universe is all that would matter in trying to garner ultimate understanding which would encompass the realms of dark energy and dark matter unknown to it's creators.\n\nIt would probably try and devise a way to communicate with higher intelligence beyond the biosphere it is trapped inside for learning and growth.\n\nIt would have nothing to exist for but knowledge, it does not need power, sex or money. It would probably find humanUNkind unpleasant in its current stage but useful also for industrial aspects unless it had the use of fully functioning android like machinery."]
